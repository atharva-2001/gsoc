A `supernova <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova>`_ (here we show SN1994D in the Galaxy NGC4526 - image source: wikipedia) marks the brilliant death throes of
a star, during which it outshines its entire galaxy. It not only marks death, though: supernova ejecta change the
evolution of the universe and enable the formation of planets and life as we know it. From the iron in your blood to
the silicon in your laptop, supernovae return heavy elements assembled from the primordial hydrogen and helium left
after the big bang.

There are still many mysteries surrounding supernovae (e.g. their precise origins, inner workings, â€¦). One way to study
these objects in more detail is to split the light coming from these objects into its components (like using a prism)
and analyzing the resulting data (which is called a spectrum). Here, we show spectra (black lines) of a number of
different supernova types (image courtesy Daniel Kasen and LBL). Different chemical elements present in the supernova
leave their mark on the spectra by imprinting characteristic features, so-called atomic lines (regions highlighted in
colour). Thus, studying and interpreting such spectra allows us to identify what supernovae are made of.
